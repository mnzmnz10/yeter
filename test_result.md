# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:

The enhanced performance optimizations are working excellently and successfully handle large datasets efficiently as required."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

This prevents users from updating labor costs, discounts, or products in existing quotes. REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ATTENTION."

DIAGNOSIS: Even though the quantity fix (p.quantity vs 1) appears to be implemented in the code, the entire editing UI is not rendering. This suggests the issue is deeper than just quantity loading - the conditional rendering logic for the editing interface is completely broken. The quote loading mechanism fails to trigger any UI changes, preventing users from editing any existing quotes. COMPLETE FUNCTIONALITY FAILURE - REQUIRES IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION AND FIX."

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The quote loading mechanism in lines 2526-2537 of App.js is completely non-functional. Despite the code appearing to set selectedProducts and selectedProductsData states, the React component is not re-rendering with the loaded quote data. This prevents the conditional rendering logic (selectedProducts.size > 0) from showing the editing interface. The setActiveTab('quotes') call works, but the product loading fails silently. COMPLETE FUNCTIONALITY BREAKDOWN - USERS CANNOT EDIT ANY EXISTING QUOTES. REQUIRES IMMEDIATE MAIN AGENT ATTENTION TO FIX THE QUOTE LOADING STATE MANAGEMENT ISSUE."

CONCLUSION: Backend quote creation API is fully functional (86.5% test success rate). The editing issue is a frontend state management problem, not a backend data storage issue. The problem lies in how the frontend sends product data to the backend or in specific user interaction patterns."
