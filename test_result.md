# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

        comment: "Completed the quick quote creation feature implementation. Added activeTab state management to control tabs programmatically. Updated createQuickQuote function to automatically navigate to quotes tab after successful quote creation. The feature workflow: 1) User selects products in products tab, 2) Clicks 'Teklif Oluştur' button, 3) Enters customer name in dialog, 4) Quote is created and user is automatically taken to quotes tab. All functionality implemented including error handling, input validation, and UI feedback."

Previously when user searched for 'akü', selected products, then searched for 'panel', the akü products would disappear from selection. The fix involved adding selectedProductsData state (Map<productId, productData>) to store complete product information separately from the filtered products list. This ensures selected products persist across different searches and filters. The toggleProductSelection function now maintains both selectedProducts (for quantities) and selectedProductsData (for complete product info) maps, preventing selection loss during search operations."

DIAGNOSIS: Even though the quantity fix (p.quantity vs 1) appears to be implemented in the code, the entire editing UI is not rendering. This suggests the issue is deeper than just quantity loading - the conditional rendering logic for the editing interface is completely broken.

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The quote loading mechanism in lines 2526-2537 of App.js is completely non-functional. Despite the code appearing to set selectedProducts and selectedProductsData states, the React component is not re-rendering with the loaded quote data. This prevents the conditional rendering logic (selectedProducts.size > 0) from showing the editing interface. The setActiveTab('quotes') call works, but the product loading fails silently.
